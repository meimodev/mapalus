  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/images/
  - assets/vectors/

  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
  - family: Poppins
    fonts:
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Black.ttf
      weight: 900
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
      weight: 700
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
      weight: 800
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
      weight: 200
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf
      weight: 300
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
      weight: 500
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
      weight: 400
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
      weight: 600
    - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Thin.ttf
      weight: 100
